A simple Fresh server providing a client that interacts with the associated
server: https://github.com/deer/fresh_cors_example_server

The client can be viewed at: https://fresh-cors-example-client.deno.dev/

Heavily inspired by https://github.com/troygoode/node-cors-client, which is a
node/express version.
